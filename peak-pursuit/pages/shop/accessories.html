                Fitbit Charge 5 - our most advanced health & fitness tracker<br>
                <br>
                Fitbit Charge 5 + Premium connects the dots between your activity, sleep and stress so you can make the
                best decisions for your body, mind and health. It all starts with your 1-month Premium membership and
                Daily Readiness, a score based on activity, sleep and heart rate variability (HRV) that helps you
                optimize your workout routine. Enhance your recovery routine with advanced stress-management tools like
                the on-wrist EDA sensor. Stay ahead of heart health with atrial fibrillation (AFib) heart rhythm
                assessments using the on-wrist ECG app. And you’ll always have motivation to reach new goals with
                hundreds of guided workouts, a gallery of refreshing mindfulness sessions plus the fitness features you
                know and love like Active Zone Minutes and built-in GPS. Fitbit is part of the Google family.<br>
