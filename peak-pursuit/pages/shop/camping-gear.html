                for carrying and helps to minimize storage space in your car and at home. Things can get messy when
                you’re in the great outdoors, but don’t fret, this sleeping bag is machine washable so it’s easy to
                ensure your bag is ready for the next adventure. Whether you're taking the family on an extended camping
